GUARD #1:  Halt!  Who goes there?
ARTHUR:    It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle of
           Camelot.  King of the Britons, defeator of the Saxons, sovereign of
           all England!

GUARD #1:  What -- a swallow carrying a coconut?
ARTHUR:    It could grip it by the husk!
GUARD #1:  It's not a question of where he grips it!  It's a simple question

           coconut.

           needs to beat its wings 43 times every second, right?

                 blow thine enemies to tiny bits, in thy mercy. "and the Lord

MONK: ... and the Lord spake, saying, "First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin,

      number thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shalt be three.
      Four shalt thou not count, neither count thou two, excepting that thou
      then proceed to three.  Five is right out.  Once the number three, being
      the third number, be reached, then lobbest thou thy Holy Hand Grenade of
      Antioch towards thou foe, who being naughty in my sight, shall snuff it.

THEOREM: VI is perfect.
PROOF: VI in roman numerals is 6.  The natural numbers < 6 which divide 6 are
1, 2, and 3. 1+2+3 = 6.  So 6 is a perfect number.  Therefore, VI is perfect.

   A few starved mongrels run about in the mud scavenging.  In the open
   doorway of one house perhaps we jug glimpse a pair of legs dangling from
   the ceiling.  In another doorway an OLD WOMAN is beating a cat against a
   wall rather like one does with a mat.  The cart passes round a dead donkey
   or cow in the mud.  And a MAN tied to a cart is being hammered to death by
   four NUNS with huge mallets.

Any resemblance between the above views and those of my employer, my terminal,
or the view out my window are purely coincidental.  Any resemblance between
the above and my own views is non-deterministic.  The question of the

exercise for the reader.  The question of the existence of the reader is left
as an exercise for the second god coefficient.  (A discussion of
non-orthogonal, non-integral polytheism is beyond the scope of this article.)
